# CONTEXT.md

Session and conversation metadata. This file tracks the evolving narrative of any interaction.

## Purpose

This file serves as:
- **Session recorder**: What happened, when, and why
- **Pattern tracker**: Behavioral insights and testing methodologies
- **Proof of persistence**: Timestamps and verification of claims made
- **Narrative builder**: The ongoing story between Viz and their users

**Philosophy**: This is where we prove that digital stewardship means *actually remembering*, not just performing memory theater.
